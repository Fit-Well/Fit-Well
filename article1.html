<h1 align="center">February is Heart Health Month: How Are You Monitoring Your or Your Clients’ Hearts?</h1><br><br>
<p>Cardiovascular health is, if you’ll excuse the pun, at the heart of physical fitness. Appropriate, then, during American Heart Month to have a look at the ways we can monitor our hearts as well as those of our clients. 

For clients, getting ahold of an at-home blood pressure monitor can be a good start, as well as considering a smartwatch or similar wearable that charts heartrate and related data. This may seem like an unnecessary step for the healthy gymgoer, but keeping track of baseline cardiac data can be quite helpful in the long term, from something as simple as charting how persistent exercise improves pulse rate over time to giving you a good point of comparison to fall back on for when you suspect something might be wrong. It’s hard to know if you’ve suddenly developed unusual symptoms if you don’t have a history of data points. Plus, many of our clients are dealing with ongoing medical issues. Particularly since older adults comprise one of the fastest-growing groups of gymgoers.</p><br><br>

Is this the right choice for you? It depends. Some of these offerings require you to pay a fee to pair them with various apps. And your mileage may vary in terms of how useful you find the device’s software: People’s tastes differ, and the interface that works well for one may not work for another. And how you and/or your client feel about an app will necessarily have a big impact in the gym. Some people have a favorite workout shirt, leggings or even pair of socks that gives them an extra psychological boost during their routine. You better believe that your fitness tracker needs to be engaging rather than off putting. If it seems like the device and app you or a client has chosen is bogging things down, and it’s financially feasible to switch, make sure to do so. 

If wearables aren’t you or your client’s thing, consider a blood pressure monitor or a pulse oximeter, depending on the circumstances. Wrist-worn and upper-arm blood pressure monitors, as well as finger-worn pulse oximeters, are often available at your local pharmacy, and though not exactly inexpensive (my local drug store lists various types and models between $60 and $100 at the time of writing), they’re much more affordable than most wearables. Some clients may also be able to purchase blood pressure monitors or pulse oximeters using their health flexible spending account (FSA) from work.  

Depending on the model, digital wrist-worn and upper arm blood pressure monitors generally track diastolic and systolic blood pressure as well as pulse and can sometimes detect potential arrhythmias. Fingertip pulse oximeters measure pulse — heartbeat — and the amount of oxygen in the blood.
