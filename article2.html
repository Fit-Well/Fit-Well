<h1 align="center">Why Checking the Box to Exercise isn’t Sufficient for Your Health?</h1><br>
<p>
The sound of an alarm wakes you up at 6:30 a.m. to start your day. Upon waking up, you decide to go for a jog at the local park, but you are restricted to 30 minutes because of a work meeting scheduled for 8:30 at the office. After exercising, you sit down to pour your favorite cereal and eat breakfast, before driving to work for 20 minutes. You arrive in time for your meeting, which lasts longer than expected, ending around 10. Once the meeting is over, you return to your office to catch up on emails and tasks before going to lunch meeting with a few co-workers. While at lunch, you and your co-workers share personal stories and work-related updates for about an hour before returning to the office to finish up tasks and additional meetings prior to leaving work at 4:30 p.m. After leaving work, you drive back home to cook dinner leftovers before watching television until bedtime around 10 p.m. A similar but different routine repeats the following day - but why is this important even though you exercised?! 

The 24-hour day entails four distinct behaviors called the 24-hour activity cycle. These behaviors are sleep, sedentary behavior, light physical activity, and moderate to vigorous physical activity. Current physical activity guidelines recommend that adults engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity, at least 75 minutes per week of vigorous physical activity or some combination of both. Sedentary behavior recommendations suggest adults “sit less and move more” due to a paucity of evidence during the development of the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Finally, the National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults sleep at least seven hours a day. Thus, accurately measuring all these behaviors and meeting their recommendations pose a challenge.

To help inform a paradigm shift in this area future progress should be established in different areas. Research investigation should consider examining efforts to determine appropriate levels of sleep, sedentary behavior, light physical activity, and moderate to vigorous physical activity (or in certain combinations) to establish optimal 24-hour day recommendations. The fitness and medical community may also benefit in this area by exploring innovative tactics to understand time spent beyond their client’s exercise session to design a healthy 24-hour day. </p>
